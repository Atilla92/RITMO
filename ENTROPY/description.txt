This folder contains several scripts to analyse the Pilot Sevilla Data


ELANanalysis
    Estimates average flow and improvisation rating for each ELAN annotation.
    Includes both Guitarist and Dancer


fMRI_analysis
    work in progress

main.py 
    Estimates the LZ entropy of audio files. 
    Need to set paramterers for window. 
    Some of the functions are stores in functionsE.py

mean.py can probably be discarded
merge.py can probably be discarded as well. 

plots.py
    Mainly statistical plots from .csv file coming from ELANanalysis.py


setWindow.py
    Used to estimate window length for data. 
    Look in the plot where fluctuations start to calm down. 

testing.py
    Sanity check with another computer whether the LZ computed renders the same values. 


variance.py
    Estimates the entropy as f(variance)
    Stores plots and outputs in seperate folder.
