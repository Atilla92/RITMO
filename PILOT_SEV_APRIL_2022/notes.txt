# Experiment notes

## Take into account when analysing data
During the experiments of P3 and G1, wrong paper was used for 2 experiments. Should be reversed in video and audio nomenclature. 
P3_D5_G1_M5_R1_T1--> P3_D1_G1_M1_R1_T1
P3_D1_G1_M1_R1_T1--> P3_D5_G1_M5_R1_T1

## Observations during experiments
Day 1 participants seemed to be much more enthousiastic and enjoying the improvisation tasks. 
What could be the cause of this?
- Connectedness between participants could be a crucial factor --> Ask in future cuestionnaire
- See whether this is linked with how much the person enjoyed the task?

G2 has not performed in tablao settings. According to P4, G2 did not follow her in her movements. 
Everytime she proposed something in her dance, the guitarist would not follow. Instead G2 was constantly proposing new material which she needed to follow.
This made the improvisation task quite hard for her. 

--> Make it even clearer that the guitarist should follow the dancer. 


## For next experiment
- Amount of pleasure
- Connectedness
- FSR?
